#In this project, I worked with a dataset called chinook, representing a digital media store including information about artists, albums, invoices, customers, employees, etc.
#Below are the questions I came up with to analyze the dataset, as well as the SQL code I wrote to answer these questions.

#1. Show the first and last names of customers who live in France as well as their billing city.
SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName
, customers.country, invoices.billingcity
FROM chinook.customers
LEFT OUTER JOIN invoices
ON customers.customerID=invoices.customerid
WHERE customers.country='France';

#2. Find the track name, composer (if applicable), and milliseconds for all tracks that start with T and fall under 200,000 milliseconds.
SELECT tracks.name, tracks.composer
,tracks.milliseconds
FROM chinook.tracks
WHERE tracks.name LIKE 'T%'
AND milliseconds<200000;

#3. What are the total sales for 2013?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31';

#4. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2013?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepID=emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND INv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2013%'
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2)) DESC LIMIT 1;

#5. Show the name and hire date for employees hired in 2002.
SELECT FirstName, HireDate
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE HireDate LIKE '%2002%';

#6. Find a unique list of billing cities from the invoice table, and place them in alphabetical order.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCity
FROM chinook.Invoices
ORDER BY BillingCity asc;

#7. Show the full names, customer ID, and country of customers who are not in Canada or the United States.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != "USA"
AND Country != "Canada";

#8. Write a query that shows the invoice ID and billing city associated with each sales agent.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCity
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv On Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#9. How many invoices were there in 2013?
SELECT COUNT(*)
AS Amount_Invoices
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31';

#10. Show the full name, phone number, and email of all IT members, staff and management included.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Phone, Email
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE 'IT%'

#11. What are the total sales for 2013?
SELECT SUM(Total)
AS Total_Sales
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31';

#12. Write a query that shows the number of customers in each country.
SELECT country, COUNT(country)
AS Customer_Count
FROM chinook.customers
GROUP BY country;
